# FATE-LLM: PDSS
The Algorithm is based on paper ["PDSS: A Privacy-Preserving Framework for Step-by-Step Distillation of Large Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12403), which introduce a novel framework for privacy preserving federated distillation. We integrate its code into the FATE-LLM framework.
